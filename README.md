## The Nunjucks engine for Pattern Lab / Node

To install the Nunjucks engine in your edition, `npm install patternengine-node-nunjucks` should do the trick.

Level of Support is more or less full. Partial calls and lineage hunting are supported. Nunjucks does not support the mustache-specific syntax extensions, style modifiers and pattern parameters, because their use cases are addressed by the core Nunjucks feature set.
